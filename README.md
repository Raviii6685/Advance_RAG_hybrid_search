The provided notebook demonstrates a structured implementation of **hybrid search** and **efficient GPU utilization** for text processing, retrieval, and generation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Text Processing and Similarity Search**

#### **Preprocessing**:
- Text is preprocessed to ensure consistency:
  - Converted to lowercase.
  - Punctuations are removed using regular expressions (`re` library).

#### **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
- Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to transform text into sparse embeddings.
- These embeddings represent the relative importance of terms in documents.
- Cosine similarity is used to compute the relevance of a query to each document.

#### **BM25 for Keyword Search**:
- BM25, an enhanced version of TF-IDF, ranks documents based on keyword relevance.
- It is particularly effective for sparse vector-based information retrieval.

---

### **2. Dense Vectors and Semantic Search**

#### **Dense Embeddings**:
- Dense vector representations are generated for documents and queries using models like `HuggingFaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings`.
- These embeddings capture the semantic context of the text, enabling more accurate retrieval beyond simple keyword matching.

#### **Cosine Similarity**:
- Dense vectors are compared using cosine similarity to rank documents based on their semantic closeness to the query.

---

### **3. Hybrid Search Approach**

#### **Combining Sparse and Dense Retrieval**:
- Sparse (BM25) and dense (vector embeddings) methods are combined using **EnsembleRetriever**.
- Weighted scores from both approaches are used to rank documents, achieving a balance between keyword matching and semantic understanding:
  \[
  \text{Hybrid Score} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Sparse Score} + \alpha \times \text{Dense Score}
  \]

### **4. Document Splitting and Retrieval**

#### **Document Chunking**:
- Documents are split into smaller, overlapping chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- Chunking ensures effective embedding generation and retrieval for large texts.

#### **Hybrid Retriever**:
- Combines a BM25 retriever and a dense retriever built with `Chroma` vector store.
- Ensures robust and diverse retrieval of relevant content.

---

### **5. Text Generation with Pre-trained Models**

#### **Model and Tokenizer Initialization**:
- Utilizes the Hugging Face model **"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta"** with quantization for memory efficiency.
- Tokenization and embeddings are optimized for inference using `BitsAndBytesConfig`.

#### **Pipeline for Text Generation**:
- Text generation is achieved using Hugging Face's `pipeline` function with the quantized model, enabling efficient large-scale generation tasks.

---

### **6. Efficient GPU Usage**

#### **Quantization**:
- Model weights and operations are quantized to 4-bit precision using `bitsandbytes` to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed.

#### **Optimizations**:
- Mixed-precision training and inference (FP16/BF16).
- Asynchronous operations and gradient accumulation for large batch sizes.

---

### **7. Final Workflow**

#### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
- The hybrid retriever fetches relevant content.
- A pre-trained language model (e.g., Zephyr-7B Beta) generates responses based on the retrieved information.
